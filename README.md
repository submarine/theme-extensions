# Theme Extensions
This repository is a clone of the Shopify [theme app extensions](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/online-store/theme-app-extensions) that ship with [Submarine](https://getsubmarine.com), a platform for building flexible commerce experiences on top of Shopify.

It's intended as a reference point for developers working with the platform to better understand the data structure used by Submarine subscriptions, presales, and crowdfunding campaigns and to see how to use that data structure to build streamlined customer experiences.
Submarine customers and partners are also welcome to fork this repository to customise the extensions to suit their own needs via an extension-only custom Shopify app.

The code in this repository is updated automatically alongside production releases of the Submarine platform codebase.

See the page on [front end integration](https://docs.getsubmarine.com/front-end-integration#9d157abc9b84441d8294dc8e07b78d02) in the Submarine docs to learn more.
